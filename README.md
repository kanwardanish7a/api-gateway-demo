This repository demonstrates an **API Gateway** that provides:
- âœ… **Routing** (Forwarding requests to microservices)
- âœ… **Authentication & Authorization** (JWT-based security)
- âœ… **Rate Limiting** (Preventing abuse)

1. **ApiGateway/** â†’ Manages authentication, authorization, routing, and rate limiting.
2. **TradeService/** â†’ Provides trade-related data.
3. **BookService/** â†’ Provides book-related data.
